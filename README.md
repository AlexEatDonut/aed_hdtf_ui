# General information

AlexEatDonut's new rendition of an ui, made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Because of web browsers caring more about your User Experience than this kind of web projects, the video and its sound in the background are off by default. You can play it and unmute it by tabbing onto the video controls.

# "How do i test it out ?"

You can see the result of the work about in real time in here : https://aedhdtfui.netlify.app
At some point I will bother hosting the page somewhere else, but for now, that will do.

# "Imma yoink your code :trollface:"

I couldn't care less. It's not like you will be able to understand anything. Plus, I made sure it's free to "kindly borrow".
The only condition is that I would prefer to be credited if this is mentionned or used in a commercial project, especially videos (even if you get no moeny out of it), but you're not _legally_ obligated to.
